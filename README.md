# Digitize Plot

## Introduction

Have you ever needed to convert data from a graphical format and found yourself painstakingly entering data in a spreadsheet while zooming in and out on the plot image?

Enter [**digitizeplot.com**](https://digitizeplot.com/).

This web app allows users to upload an image of a plot, calibrate an x and y scale, drop as many points as they would like on it, then export those points to CSV with accurate coordinates.

## How it Works

## How I Built It

This single-page React application is written in Typescript and hosted on GitHub Pages. I made use of several libraries such as react-csv, react-konva (for the canvas) and react-dropzone.

## Future Plans

In the future I would consider adding options for different axis scales such as logarithmic and datetime. As well I would like to improve the general fit and finish for a better user experience.
